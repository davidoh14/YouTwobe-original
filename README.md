## Comments
The comments section was an interesting challenge that exposed me to the intricacies of the React life-cycle and the considerations you have to make with multiple components on the same screen. I organized the comments under an overarching comments section, with an input form to create a comment as a child component, and a separate index that renders all comments with the appropriate foreign key that matched the video's primary key. Posting a new comment did not automatically trigger the separate comment index to re-render. In this case, I had to create conditionals on the commments section parent component to re-fetch all comments on the slice-of-state change of the comments length, which becomes increased by the comment form input.

```
    componentDidMount(){
        this.props.fetchAllComments(this.props.videoId)
    
    }

    componentDidUpdate(prevProps){
        if ((this.props.videoId !== prevProps.videoId) || (this.props.comments.length !== prevProps.comments.length)) {
            this.props.fetchAllComments(this.props.videoId)
        }
    }
```
Another challenge along the same lines was that posting a comment after changing pages, would post that comment on the previous page. It's the same issue here where the parent component re-rendered, but the comment form hadn't yet. So I used the following code to have th comment form update it's state with the proper video foreign key.
```
    currentUserAndVideoCheck(){
        if (!this.props.currentUserId) {
            this.props.history.push('/login')
        } else {
            this.setState({video_id: this.props.videoId}) 
        }
    }
```

## Video Upload
I added a completely new skill by learning how to upload and host files on an AWS server. There was much more code behind the scenes to enable this code to work, but the following is the code on the frontend to enable users to upload videos of their own: 
```
    uploadVideo(e){
        const file = e.currentTarget.files[0];
        const fileReader = new FileReader();
        fileReader.onloadend = () => {
            this.setState({ video: file, videoUrl: fileReader.result});
        };

        if (file) {
            fileReader.readAsDataURL(file);
        }
    }

    uploadThumbnail(e){
        const file = e.currentTarget.files[0];
        const fileReader = new FileReader();
        fileReader.onloadend = () => {
            this.setState({ thumbnail: file, thumbnailUrl: fileReader.result});
        };

        if (file) {
            fileReader.readAsDataURL(file);
        }
    }
```
